Here is one possible design for the datastore:

We will use a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store the monitoring data, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. The reason for using an RDBMS is that it provides a structured way to store and query data, and it can handle large amounts of data efficiently.

The datastore will have the following tables:

users: This table will store the user data, such as their ID and name.
apis: This table will store the API data, such as their ID and name.
requests: This table will store the data for each request made to an API, such as the request time, response time, and whether the request was successful or not.

the schema for the tables in schema file...
